# Football Project

Some cool data visualisation scripts (a lot still in progress) with data from [statsbomb](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data) or [understat](https://understat.com/).

## Scripts

- `shotmap.py` uses [understat](https://understat.com/) data to create "The Athletic" style shotmaps for players from PL, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1 and the Russian Premier League.


## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

to your favourite virtual environment.
